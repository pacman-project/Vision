DESCRIPTION:

Two-dimensional articulated shapes (silhouettes) for non-rigid shape similarity experiments.
The data set contains 35 shapes: 5x2 scissors, 5x3 pliers, 5 pincers, 5 knives. Each shape 
differs by an articulation. The shapes are represented as binary images in .bmp format.

This data set is distributed as part of the TOSCA (Toolbox for Surface Comparison and
Analysis) project and may be used for academic purposes. Any publication using the database 
should mention references [1-2] below.
