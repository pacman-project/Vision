DESCRIPTION:

Two-dimensional articulated shapes (silhouettes) for partial similarity experiments. The 
data set contains 15 shapes: 5 humans, 5 horses and 5 centaurs. Each shape differs by an 
articulation and additional parts. The shapes are represented as binary images in .bmp 
format.


LICENSE: 

This data set is distributed as part of the TOSCA (Toolbox for Surface Comparison and 
Analysis) project and may be used for academic purposes. Any publication using the database
should mention references [1-2] below.
